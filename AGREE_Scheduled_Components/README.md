# Assume-Guarantee Reasoning with Scheduled Components
Prototype implementation of AGREE with scheduled components

Files:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
sch.py: Python script that introduces scheduling semantics to a Lustre model  

downsample.aadl:	AADL model of a simple "downsampling" system  
downsample_sch.aadl:	AADL model of a simple "downsampling" system with scheduling semantics manually encoded  
downsample.lus: 	Lustre model generated from "downsample.aadl" by AGREE, where the property cannot be proved  
downsample_sch.txt:	schedule definition  
downsample_sch.lus:	Lustre model generated by "sch.py" with scheduling semantics, where the property can be proved  
  
integer_toy.aadl:	AADL model of the AGREE integer toy system  
integer_toy_sch.aadl:	AADL model of the AGREE integer toy system with scheduling semantics (schedule 1) manually encoded  
integer_toy.lus:	Lustre model generated from "integer_toy.aadl" by AGREE, where the property can be proved  
integer_toy_sch1.txt:	schedule 1 definition  
integer_toy_sch1.txt:	schedule 2 definition  
integer_toy_sch1.lus:	Lustre model generated by "sch.py" with schedule 1, where the property can be proved  
integer_toy_sch2.lus:	Lustre model generated by "sch.py" with schedule 2, where the property cannot be proved  
  
simple_feedback.aadl:		AADL model of a simple feedback system  
simple_feedback_sch.aadl:	AADL model of a simple feedback system with scheduling semantics manually encoded  
  
uav.lus:		Lustre model generated from the DARPA CASE UAV SW AADL model by AGREE, where the property can be proved  
uav_sch.txt:		schedule definition  
uav_sch.lus:		Lustre model generated by "sch.py" with scheduling semantics, where the property can be proved  

To generate Lustre model with scheduling semantics  
----------------------------------------------------
>sch.py -i input_lustre_file_name.lus -s schedule_file_name.txt   
Example:  
>sch.py -i downsample.lus -s downsample_sch.txt  

To check property
----------------------------------------------------
>jkind -solver z3 lustre_file_name.lus  
Example:   
>jkind downsample_sch.lus
